#### What is Git, Github, Repo, and Commit?
* Git is a software
* Clone - make a copy of an entire repository from a remote copy to a local copy.
* Local allows you to edit it straight off of your computer.
* Commit - is to snapshot the changes
* Repo is a Repository
  * Push - send your saves from a local place
  * Pull - get saves from a local place  
* Github allows many people to work on a repo without it getting hectic by using pushing and pulling. It makes it so that everyone can edit the repo locally so nothing changes until they push and pull these changes
* They have to pull before they can push
	Test Notes/Corrections 
* gui is NOT another name for Command Line Interface
#### IDE 
* IDE = Integrated Development Environment
* cs50.dev
* Hstatsep.github.io/code50/
#### Test Corrections
* Remote is on Github and Local is on IDE
* A new project is called a Repository
* When we use git commit we have to include a message
* Use q to quit when you use the git log so the output can fit on the screen
