#### What is Git, Github, Repo, and Commit?
  * Git is a software
  *   Clone - make a copy of an entire repository from a remote copy to a local copy.
Local allows you to edit it straight off of your computer.
Commit - is to snapshot the changes
Push - send your saves from a local place
Pull - get saves from a local place  
Github allows many people to work on a repo without it getting hectic by using pushing and pulling. It makes it so that everyone can edit the repo locally so nothing changes until they push and pull these changes
They have to pull before they can push
